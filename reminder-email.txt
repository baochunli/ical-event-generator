Good morning!

With this email message, I wish to remind you to send me a brief update as a starting point of our meeting tomorrow morning, by 5:00 p.m. today. It should take no more than, say, 10-15 minutes of your time.

I felt like a broken record, but once again I thought it is worth noting that some were sending me an "agenda" for the upcoming one-on-one meeting. In my note in the internal website regarding individual weekly meetings, I did not ask for meeting agendas; rather, these short meetings typically have an open agenda. An "update" is an answer to the question "What have you done last week?", and perhaps also to the questions "What questions are still open?" and "What are your plans in the near-term future?"

I look forward to some productive discussions soon.

Best regards,
Baochun
