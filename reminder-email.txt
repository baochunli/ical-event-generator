Just a quick reminder for your weekly update today. 

It would be best if you can send it to me by 6:00 p.m. according to the following internal website:

[Group Policy on Weekly Updates](https://github.com/iQua/internal-website/wiki/Weekly-updates)

In your weekly updates, please describe **the work you have done in the preceding week** since the last time you sent your update, as well as **your plans for the upcoming week**.

Thank you!

Best regards,
Baochun
