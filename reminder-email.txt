Another week arrives :)

I am writing this to remind you to send a brief update as a starting point of our meeting tomorrow morning. It should take no more than, say, 10-15 minutes of your time. Thanks in advance for keeping these meetings productive!

Though this may be a small thing, I thought that it is worth noting in this message that some were sending me an "agenda" for the upcoming one-on-one meeting. In my note in the internal website regarding individually weekly meetings, I did not ask for meeting agendas; rather, these short meetings typically have an open agenda. An "update" is an answer to the question "What have you done last week?", and perhaps also to the questions "What questions are still open?" and "What are your plans in the near-term future?"

I look forwarding to some productive discussions soon.

Best regards,
Baochun
