Please ignore this message if you have done it already, but this is just a quick reminder that you should send a brief update as a starting point of our meeting tomorrow morning. It shouldn't take more than, say, ten minutes. Thank you very much in advance for your time, so that we can keep these meetings productive.

Best regards,
Baochun
