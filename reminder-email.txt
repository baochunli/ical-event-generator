Thank you for the updates in the past two weeks, making these meetings much more productive! This email is, of course, to remind you to send a brief update as a starting point of our meeting tomorrow morning. It should take no more than 10-15 minutes of your time. Again, an "update" should at least provide a high-level idea on what has been done recently.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to reinforce the idea that we can chat about ongoing work at any time, rather than only at these meetings. These one-on-one meetings will provide a "lower bound" with respect to the amount of discussions every week, but there is no "upper bound." I am easily reachable via a variety of means, most importantly Telegram and phone calls. 

I look forward to some productive discussions soon.

Best regards,
Baochun
